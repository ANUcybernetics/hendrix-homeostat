## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Write comprehensive unit tests for audio analysis functions. Test with known signal patterns (silence, sine waves, square waves) to verify calculations. Use pure data without requiring actual audio hardware.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Test suite created at test/audio_analysis_test.exs
- [x] #2 Tests verify calculate_rms/1 with silence (expect 0.0), full-scale signal (expect 1.0), and known sine wave
- [x] #3 Tests verify zero_crossing_rate/1 with DC signal (expect 0.0), alternating signal (expect 1.0), and known frequencies
- [x] #4 Tests verify peak/1 with silence, full-scale signal, and various amplitude patterns
- [x] #5 Tests verify edge cases (empty list, single sample, very long lists)
- [x] #6 Tests verify normalization to 0.0-1.0 range for RMS and peak values
- [x] #7 All tests pass with 'mix test'
