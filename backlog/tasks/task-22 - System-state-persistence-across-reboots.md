## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement optional state persistence to remember configuration and state across system reboots. Save calibration data, successful parameter tunings, and last known good configuration. Useful for field deployment where manual reconfiguration after reboot is undesirable.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 State persistence module created using Nerves persistent storage
- [ ] #2 Configuration overrides can be saved and loaded from persistent storage
- [ ] #3 Calibration data (if any) persisted across reboots
- [ ] #4 Last known good threshold values saved on successful operation
- [ ] #5 System loads persisted state on boot if available
- [ ] #6 Fallback to default config if persisted state corrupted or unavailable
- [ ] #7 Verified state persists across firmware updates when appropriate
- [ ] #8 Documentation added for state persistence behavior
