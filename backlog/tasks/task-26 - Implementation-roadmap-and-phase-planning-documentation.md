## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a document that outlines the overall implementation phases for the Hendrix homeostat project, showing how the individual tasks (3-25) group together into logical phases and explaining the dependencies between phases. This provides a high-level view of the project implementation sequence so developers can understand the big picture and how tasks relate to each other.
