## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement robust error recovery throughout the system. Handle Port crashes, MIDI device disconnection, audio device failures, and GenServer crashes gracefully. Ensure system can recover from transient failures without manual intervention.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 AudioBackend.Port restarts with exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, max 5s)
- [ ] #2 Circuit breaker pattern for repeated Port failures (open after 5 failures in 30s)
- [ ] #3 MidiBackend.Amidi handles device unavailability gracefully, logs warnings
- [ ] #4 ControlLoop continues with last known metrics when AudioMonitor temporarily unavailable
- [ ] #5 ControlLoop stops sending MIDI commands if MidiController crashes (waits for restart)
- [ ] #6 USB hotplug detection using udev or polling (check device presence periodically)
- [ ] #7 Port processes cleaned up properly on GenServer crash (trap_exit, cleanup in terminate/2)
- [ ] #8 Supervision tree restart intensity: max 5 restarts in 60 seconds
- [ ] #9 Error scenarios tested: USB disconnect/reconnect, Port crashes, GenServer exits, backend failures
- [ ] #10 System recovers from transient failures within 5 seconds
- [ ] #11 Permanent failures logged with clear context (device path, error reason, recovery attempts)
- [ ] #12 Supervision tree continues operating even if one child permanently fails
