## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement robust error recovery throughout the system. Handle Port crashes, MIDI device disconnection, audio device failures, and GenServer crashes gracefully. Ensure system can recover from transient failures without manual intervention.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 AudioMonitor restarts arecord Port automatically on crash with backoff
- [ ] #2 MidiController handles MIDI device unavailability gracefully, retries on failure
- [ ] #3 ControlLoop continues operating when AudioMonitor temporarily unavailable
- [ ] #4 Supervision tree configured with appropriate restart strategies (one_for_one)
- [ ] #5 Maximum restart intensity tuned to avoid cascade failures
- [ ] #6 Error scenarios tested: USB device disconnect/reconnect, Port crashes, GenServer exits
- [ ] #7 System recovers from transient failures within 5 seconds
- [ ] #8 Permanent failures logged clearly without crashing supervision tree
