## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Profile the system to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize audio processing, metric calculation, and control loop timing. Ensure system can maintain target polling rate without dropping samples or introducing excessive latency.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Performance baseline established with :timer.tc measurements
- [ ] #2 AudioAnalysis functions profiled with various buffer sizes
- [ ] #3 AudioMonitor buffer processing time measured and optimized if needed
- [ ] #4 ControlLoop polling verified to maintain configured interval under load
- [ ] #5 Memory usage profiled and verified stable over extended operation
- [ ] #6 CPU usage measured on Pi 5 hardware and verified acceptable
- [ ] #7 System maintains 100-500ms polling rate without timing drift
- [ ] #8 Document performance characteristics in docs/performance.md
