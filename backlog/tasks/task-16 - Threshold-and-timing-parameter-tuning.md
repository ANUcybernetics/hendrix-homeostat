## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Tune control loop parameters through empirical testing with real guitar playing. Adjust threshold values, polling intervals, stability counters, and anti-stasis timing to achieve desired homeostat behavior. Document tuning process and final values.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Critical_high and critical_low thresholds tuned for guitar input levels
- [ ] #2 Comfort_zone range tuned to maintain desired equilibrium
- [ ] #3 Poll_interval_ms tuned for responsive but not overly-reactive behavior
- [ ] #4 Anti_stasis_count tuned to prevent boredom without excessive change
- [ ] #5 Patch bank selection verified to produce appropriate boost/dampen/random behaviors
- [ ] #6 Tuning process documented in docs/tuning_guide.md
- [ ] #7 Final configuration values updated in config/config.exs with rationale comments
- [ ] #8 System demonstrates stable homeostat behavior in extended testing session
