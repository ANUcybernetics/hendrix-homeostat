## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create simple visualization or logging tools to observe metrics and system behavior in real-time. Could be Logger output formatting, CSV export for plotting, or simple terminal graphs. Helps with tuning and debugging.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Metrics logging format created that is parseable for analysis
- [ ] #2 Option to log metrics to CSV file for offline plotting
- [ ] #3 Optional: simple terminal-based metric display (real-time RMS/ZCR/peak values)
- [ ] #4 Control state transitions logged in parseable format
- [ ] #5 Tools or scripts provided for basic metric visualization from logs
- [ ] #6 Documentation added showing how to analyze system behavior from logs
- [ ] #7 Verified tools are useful for debugging threshold and timing issues
