# Implementation review summary

**Date**: 2025-10-11 **Reviewer**: Elixir/OTP specialist via comprehensive
architecture review

## Review scope

Conducted thorough review of all 26 tasks in the Hendrix homeostat
implementation backlog, examining:

- Elixir/OTP architecture and patterns
- GenServer design and supervision tree
- Testing strategies and approaches
- Nerves-specific concerns
- Error handling and fault tolerance
- Configuration management
- Integration and deployment workflows

## Critical findings

### 1. Architecture improvements required

**Port-based audio capture performance concerns**

- original plan: parse PCM from arecord stdout (task-11)
- issue: ~96KB/sec binary-to-list conversion creates GC pressure
- resolution: added behaviour abstraction for testability (task-27)
- recommendation: monitor performance in task-15, consider NIF only if needed

**Polling vs push architecture**

- original plan: ControlLoop polls AudioMonitor every 100-500ms (task-8)
- issue: adds latency, timer drift, synchronization overhead
- resolution: revised to push-based metrics via message passing

**Mock-based testing**

- original plan: mock System.cmd/3 for testing (tasks 4, 5, 8, 9)
- issue: violates coding guidelines, creates brittle tests
- resolution: behaviour abstractions (MidiBackend, AudioBackend) eliminate
  mocking

### 2. Specification gaps addressed

**Supervision tree underspecified** (task-3)

- added: explicit process naming, restart strategy, shutdown timeouts
- added: startup order documentation
- added: fix for Mix.target() usage in application.ex

**Configuration system issues** (task-10)

- changed: config.exs → runtime.exs for Nerves compatibility
- added: backend selection in config
- removed: compile-time checks (Mix.env())

**Error recovery incomplete** (task-20)

- added: exponential backoff algorithm specification
- added: circuit breaker pattern
- added: USB hotplug detection
- added: Port cleanup procedures

**Observability gaps** (task-19)

- added: remote IEx setup
- added: RingLogger configuration
- added: telemetry instrumentation
- added: debugging workflow documentation

### 3. Missing functionality identified

**Integration testing gap**

- added task-28: full system integration test with simulated scenarios
- covers: silence detection, overload, anti-stasis, recovery
- validates: complete control loop before hardware deployment

**Operational procedures missing**

- added task-29: startup, shutdown, and calibration
- covers: device detection, calibration mode, graceful shutdown
- includes: state persistence, health checks

**Backend abstractions needed**

- added task-27: behaviour-based backends
- provides: MidiBackend (Amidi, InMemory) and AudioBackend (Port, File)
- enables: testing without hardware or mocking

## Task modifications

### Tasks added (3 total)

- **task-27**: behaviour-based backend abstractions
- **task-28**: full system integration test
- **task-29**: startup, shutdown, and calibration

### Tasks removed (2 total)

- **task-21**: performance profiling (premature, fold into task-15)
- **task-24**: visualization (low-value for headless device)

### Tasks merged (1 total)

- **task-2** → **task-14**: RC-600 research merged into setup docs

## Final task count

**Before review**: 26 tasks (task-1 through task-26) **After review**: 25 tasks
(removed 3, added 3, renumbered to include 27-29)

## Key architectural decisions

### 1. Push-based metrics flow

```
AudioMonitor calculates metrics → sends to ControlLoop → makes decision → casts to MidiController
```

Benefits: lower latency, no timer drift, simpler code

### 2. Behaviour-based abstractions

```elixir
# Production
config :hendrix_homeostat,
  midi_backend: MidiBackend.Amidi,
  audio_backend: AudioBackend.Port

# Testing
config :hendrix_homeostat,
  midi_backend: MidiBackend.InMemory,
  audio_backend: AudioBackend.File
```

Benefits: no mocking, real code paths, easy testing

### 3. Flat supervision tree with explicit naming

```elixir
children = [
  {MidiController, name: HendrixHomeostat.MidiController},
  {AudioMonitor, name: HendrixHomeostat.AudioMonitor},
  {ControlLoop, name: HendrixHomeostat.ControlLoop}
]
Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

Benefits: simple failure isolation, clear process discovery

### 4. Runtime configuration

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs (not config.exs)
config :hendrix_homeostat,
  critical_high: 0.8,
  critical_low: 0.05,
  # ... etc
```

Benefits: works in Nerves firmware, no compile-time issues

## Phase structure (7 phases)

1. **Foundation** (tasks 3, 27, 6, 7, 10) - pure logic, no hardware
2. **Core GenServers** (tasks 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12) - with test backends
3. **Integration** (tasks 13, 28) - full system test
4. **Hardware validation** (tasks 1, 14, 15, 16) - Pi 5 deployment
5. **Robustness** (tasks 19, 20, 29) - error handling
6. **Operational** (tasks 17, 22, 23) - tuning and config
7. **Documentation** (tasks 18, 25) - handoff

## Critical path to MVP

Minimum viable system: 12 tasks

1. task-3 (foundation)
2. task-27 (backends)
3. task-6, task-10 (pure functions, config)
4. task-4, task-8, task-11 (GenServers)
5. task-13, task-28 (integration)
6. task-1, task-14, task-15 (hardware)
7. task-16 (tuning)

## Performance recommendations

**Audio processing**: start with pure Elixir

- 10Hz update rate = 4800 samples per buffer at 48kHz
- simple RMS calculation, no heavy deps needed
- Pi 5 has ample CPU for this workload

**If optimization needed** (only after task-15 testing):

- option 1: simple C NIF (no external deps)
- option 2: Rustler (safer NIF)
- option 3: Nx/EXLA (heavy deps)

**Do not** prematurely optimize.

## Review conclusion

**Overall assessment**: solid foundation with architectural gaps

**Strengths**:

- good separation of pure functions
- appropriate use of GenServers
- flat supervision tree
- Nerves-aware approach

**Weaknesses addressed**:

- polling → push architecture
- mocking → behaviour abstractions
- underspecified supervision tree
- configuration compatibility issues
- incomplete error recovery

**Confidence level**: 80%

- 20 of 25 tasks are well-specified and implementable
- 5 tasks may need minor adjustments during implementation
- architecture is sound with revisions applied

## Next steps

1. Review revised task files (3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 19, 20)
2. Review new task files (27, 28, 29)
3. Review merged task file (14)
4. Implement according to phase structure in implementation-roadmap.md
5. Begin with Phase 1 (foundation) - all tasks can be completed without hardware
