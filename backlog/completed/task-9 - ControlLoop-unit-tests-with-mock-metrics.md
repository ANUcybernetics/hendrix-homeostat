## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Write comprehensive unit tests for ControlLoop control logic. Test threshold detection, stability tracking, anti-stasis behavior, and patch selection using mock metric values. Verify correct MIDI commands sent for each scenario.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Test suite created at test/control_loop_test.exs
- [x] #2 Tests verify critical_high threshold triggers dampen bank selection
- [x] #3 Tests verify critical_low threshold triggers boost bank selection
- [x] #4 Tests verify comfort_zone maintains current state
- [x] #5 Tests verify stability counter increments in comfort zone
- [x] #6 Tests verify anti-stasis triggers random bank after N stable readings
- [x] #7 Tests verify stability counter resets when leaving comfort zone
- [x] #8 Tests verify correct Program Change messages sent via MidiController
- [x] #9 Tests verify configurable polling interval
- [x] #10 All tests pass with 'mix test'
