## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a document that outlines the overall implementation phases for the Hendrix homeostat project, showing how the individual tasks (3-25) group together into logical phases and explaining the dependencies between phases. This provides a high-level view of the project implementation sequence so developers can understand the big picture and how tasks relate to each other.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Document created at backlog/docs/implementation-roadmap.md
- [x] #2 All 7 phases documented with their constituent tasks listed
- [x] #3 Dependencies between phases clearly explained
- [x] #4 Key milestones identified (especially Phase 4 hardware validation)
- [x] #5 Documentation includes notes about which phases can run in parallel
- [x] #6 Explanation provided for which tasks can be completed without hardware
<!-- AC:END -->

## Completion notes

Implementation roadmap created with comprehensive review and revisions:

- **Tasks revised**: 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 19, 20 (architectural improvements)
- **Tasks added**: 27 (behaviour abstractions), 28 (full integration test), 29 (startup/shutdown)
- **Tasks removed**: 21 (performance profiling), 24 (visualization)
- **Tasks merged**: 2 into 14 (RC-600 documentation)

Total task count: 26 â†’ 25 tasks (3 new, 2 removed, 1 merged)

Key architectural changes:
- push-based metrics (not polling)
- behaviour abstractions (no mocking)
- explicit supervision tree specification
- runtime config for Nerves compatibility
- enhanced error recovery and observability
